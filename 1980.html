        <p>Who was Vincent Chin?</p>
        <p>- Vincent Chin was an American man of Chinese descent who was murdered by white men in Detroit. The men blamed Chin and Japanese Americans for their unemployment and the rise of Japanese imported cars. Chin, and his friends, were at a bachelor party when the two men held Chin down and beat him with a baseball bat. The two men never received jail time.<a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/06/19/1106118117/vincent-chin-aapi-hate-incidents" target="_blank" rel="noopener" "noreferrer"> Click here for more information.</a></p>
