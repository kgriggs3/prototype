The sophomore novel lands Yu a spot as a major new voice in American fiction.

AAPI Equity Alliance, Chinese for Affirmative Action, and the Asian American Studies Department of San Francisco State University all came together for this. The coalition both tracks and responds to incidents involving hate, violence, harassment, discrimination, shunning and child bullying against Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. Their mission is to “advance equity, justice, and power by dismantling systemic racism and building a multiracial movement to end anti-Asian American and Pacific Islander hate. Along with working to end AAPI hate, the coalition also understands that they must work to end all forms of structural racism. <a href="https://stopaapihate.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" "noreferrer"> Click here to help.</a>
